# Design Patterns

learning design patterns from zero to hero

I have seen this come up quite a few times on job descriptions. Design patterns, What are design patterns, for many job applications I shamelessly said NO to knowing design patterns as I felt it was something I should have known.

I am not a CS Major, but I am a WeThinkCode_ Alumni, and as a WeThinkCoder, when you do not know something, it becomes your job to known it.

SO HERE WE GO AGAIN, time to dive into the world of design patterns!

## Overview

Design patterns are a set of best practices to use when designing your OOP applications. In total we have 23 different design patterns.

When the designing our application, the pattern we choose is highly dependent on the type of problem we are trying to solve as well as the application we are trying to build.

Thus the choice is highly dependent on the requirements of our application

The design patterns were then classified into three categorizes

1. Creation
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

## Creational patterns

Creational patterns are used when our app requires us to create an object in our application.

### Creational patterns include

1. Singleton
2. Factory
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

## Structural patterns

We use structural design pattern when we want to create applications that are composed of multiple objects.

For instance we have one Object, for a menu of a restaurant and each item in our menu is an object of its own, such as a pie object or a beverage object. Thus we can say that our menu item is composed out of the menu object, pie object and beverage object.

Note: Composition is the combination of multiple objects to produce one single application

### Structural patterns include

1. Adapter
2. Composite
3. Proxy
4. Fly weight
5. Facade
6. Bridge
7. Decorator

## Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns are used when we have two application and we are trying to communicate from Object A to Object B. Think of server-client models.

### Behavioral patterns include

1. Template Method (MVC)
2. Mediator
3. Chain of Responsibility
4. Observers
5. Strategy
6. Command
7. State
8. Visitor
9. Iterator
10. Interpreter
11. Memento

## Conclusion

When it comes to choosing the design pattern we need to think about the problem we are trying to solve, the logical approach and then we choose from it
